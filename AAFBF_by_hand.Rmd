This script based on the paper "Approximated adjusted fractional Bayes factors: A general method for testing informative hypotheses" by Gu, Mulder and Hoijtink (2018)

Two hypotheses of interest:    
 - H0: beta = 0   
 - H1: beta > 0 
 
```{r}
library(bain)
```

 
```{r}
# specify input values
estimate <- 1              # estimate for beta
names(estimate) <- "est"   # give the estimate a name that the hypothesis argument in bain can refer to
sigma_estimate <- .1       # SE of that estimate
N <- 100                   # sample size
b <- 1/N                   # b fraction according to minimal training sample (b=(J+1)/N)

# prior ~ N(0, sigma_estimate/b)
# posterior ~ N(estimate, sigma_estimate)

# calculate complexity and fit of H0
comp0 <- dnorm(0, mean=0, sd=sqrt(sigma_estimate/b))     # overlap of parameter under H0 and unconstrained prior -> density of the prior under Hu at the focal point 0
fit0 <- dnorm(0, mean=estimate, sd=sqrt(sigma_estimate)) # overlap of parameter under H0 and posterior -> density of the posterior at focal point 0
AAFBF0u <- fit0/comp0                                    # AAFBF of H0 vs Hu

# calculate complexity and fit of 1
comp1 <- pnorm(0, mean=0, sd=sqrt(sigma_estimate/b))         # always .5 for H1
fit1 <- 1 - pnorm(0, mean=estimate, sd=sqrt(sigma_estimate)) # the fit is equal to 1 - the fit of the complement
AAFBF1u <- fit1/comp1                                        # AAFBF of H0 vs Hu

# compare with output from bain
bain(estimate, hypothesis = c("est=0; est>0"), Sigma = as.matrix(sigma_estimate), n=N, fraction = 1)
